Here, everything is shown step by step with different images as output to show the whole process.

In this project, one can throw in any threat object and any baggage image can be added with the required weapon but proper data must be fed in order to achieve so.

---------------------
Step-0
---------------------
[+]Image is taken from file which is then sent for extraction and then padding is done.

[+]Padding is done so that the required part is not getting clipped off while rotation.

[+]In some cases where knives were placed diagonally, then the rotation makes some part of knife out of range from length and breadth.

[+]Also 45 degree rotation was made to meet the requirements.


------------------------
Step-1
-----------------------
[+]Here background removal part is carried out at the first step.

[+]Also some transparency was also given.


-----------------------
Step-2
-----------------------
[+]Overlaying of both the images were done.

[+]Straightaway using the png image was just clipping off the background image.

-----------------------
Step-3, not mandatory
-----------------------
[+]Contrast is varied for clarity.

[+]Further clarity is given by adding white to the background into the image.

[+]Clarity part can also be done in step 1 itself.
